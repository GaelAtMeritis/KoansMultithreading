## Installation

Use have two options. 
* The first one (and the simplest on) is to use the version 16.3.1 of Visual Studio.
* The second on is if any reason you want to keep a version between 16.0.0 and 16.3.0, you must 
install the .Netcore 3 SDK release candidate 1. In this case, yyou must allow visual studio to 
use SDK preview.

You find here the link for the package/SDK download:
